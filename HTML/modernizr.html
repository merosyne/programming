<!--
polyfill (n): a JavaScript shim that replicates the standard API for older browsers

Loading polyfills based on capabilities:
Modernizr.load({
  test: Modernizr.geolocation,
  yep : 'geo.js',
  nope: 'geo-polyfill.js'
});

Also see more complicated example here: http://modernizr.com/docs/#installing

HTML 5 shiv:
- Modernizr runs through a little loop in JavaScript to enable the various elements from HTML5 (as well as abbr) 
  for styling in Internet Explorer.
- As of Modernizr 1.5, this script is identical to what is used in the popular html5shim/html5shiv library
